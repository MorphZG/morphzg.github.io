- Static Site generated by [Astro.js](https://astro.build/).
- Open source repository available at [github.com/morphzg/morphzg_github.io](https://github.com/MorphZG/morphzg.github.io).
- Deployed at: [morphzg.github.io](https://morphzg.github.io). Deployed with custom actions workflow which can be previewed at: [deployment workflow](https://github.com/MorphZG/morphzg.github.io/blob/main/.github/workflows/deploy.yml).
- Github pages support only static websites. Even though Astro.js provides many different API's and deployment setting, github pages will only display prerendered **static sites**. Learn more about Astro configuration at [docs.astro/configuration_reference](https://docs.astro.build/en/reference/configuration-reference/).
- Astro.js outputs zero client side javascript by default but it is possible to override it by using `astro islands`. When your Astro component does need client-side interactivity, you can add standard HTML `<script>` tag or UI Framework components. If you compare code inside `pages/` or `layouts/` directories with `components/SearchForm.astro` for example, you will notice that former directories utilise frontmatter to separate javascript from the rest of the code. What happens with the frontmatter at the build time, is that final output is pure HTML without zero javascript, simple static HTML files. Now take a look at `components/SearchForm.astro` and you will notice `<script>` tag at the bottom that can provide interactivity to the page in a form of `astro island`.
